# ML_Algo_Implementation

## Overview

In this collaborative project, Vaibhav Chemboli and Samuel Vasamsetti implemented various ML algorithms like Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Means, Local Linear Embedding, Gaussian Mixture Model, One-to-One and One-to-Many using Logistic Regression. These classifiers were developed as part of our programme course, addressing different datasets and exploring the capabilities of each algorithm.
